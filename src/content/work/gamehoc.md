Our website is a one-stop destination for all gaming enthusiasts out there! We've built this platform using an API that provides a vast array of games, making it easy for users to browse through and find their favorite titles. Our website allows users to create their own collection of games that they can save for future reference.

The website was built using the popular EJS and NodeJS technologies, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. As for the development process, our team was responsible for a wide range of tasks. Specifically, my role was primarily focused on the front-end aspect of the website. This included designing the overall look and feel of the website, and then implementing this design into the final product.

We understand that gaming is more than just a hobby, it's a passion that people take seriously. That's why we've worked hard to create a website that reflects the needs and desires of gaming enthusiasts everywhere. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just starting out, we've got something for everyone. So, come and explore our website, and see for yourself what we have to offer!
