I undertook a major digital transformation project for Little Lights Dentistry via the Catchafire platform. The organization initially operated a very outdated Squarespace website that posed significant user-interface challenges, resulting in navigation and information accessibility issues.

Upon performing an in-depth assessment, I proposed an innovative design and development path. Recognizing the inefficiencies and constraints of their existing Squarespace 6 version, I recommended transitioning to Squarespace 7. This migration was necessary not only to harness the advanced features of the platform but also to facilitate custom JavaScript and CSS implementations, enhancing the overall user experience.

Due to the architectural discrepancies between the two Squarespace versions, a seamless upgrade wasn't feasible. This resulted in my building the website from the ground up, paving the way for a fresh, modern design aligning with the organization's mission and objectives. With a commitment to excellence and efficiency, I delivered this revamped website within a two-week timeframe on a part-time basis, duly meeting the stipulated deadline.

This project resulted in substantial cost savings for Little Lights Dentistry, approximately $4,000, a significant amount that can now be redirected to further their noble mission of aiding children belonging to underinsured and low income families. The board expressed immense satisfaction with the website's transformation.

Currently, the redesigned website is live and accessible at the link above. My engagement with Little Lights Dentistry goes beyond this initial project; I've forged a lasting partnership by offering continuous support, ensuring their digital platform remains effective and intuitive, so that they can worry about the things that matter.
